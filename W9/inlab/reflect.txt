1. Template functions are parametric polymorphism means compile-time 
   polymorphism, it should be instantiated by the complier before actually 
   compiling. when we move templated functions in Data.cpp, compiler can't see
   ws9_lab.cpp and when ws9_lab.cpp is compile, there will be complier errors.

2. Yes it will work when the fuction is above the main function.

3. We can do the workshop without tempeletes but we had to make long code without
   them on the onther hand we have to make duplicate code in which may be we can
   do some mistakes.

4. They both are same because use of 'typename and class' provide the same output
